The rules are simple:
Enter your name
Fight through a gauntlet of monsters
There is no penalty for losing, just dissatisfaction
enter the commands in lowercase to do something: sword, shield, heal, fireball, exit
exit does what you'd expect.
You have 6 potions and 10 fireballs (restocked at the end of a fight)
